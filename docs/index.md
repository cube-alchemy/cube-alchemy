# Cube Alchemy

**Streamlined Multidimensional Analytics in Pure Python**

Transform disconnected tables into a coherent analytical framework that seamlessly works across your entire data. Cube Alchemy creates a unified schema from your pandas DataFrames, enabling powerful cross-dimensional analysis with minimal code.

With Cube Alchemy, you gain a consistent semantic layer to interact with interconnected data. Query your entire data model as one cohesive entity instead of managing separate tables.

**Highlights**

- Simple slicing and dicing â€” less manual joins and glue code
- Reusable metrics and stateful queries
- Works great in notebooks and apps (Streamlit/Panel)
