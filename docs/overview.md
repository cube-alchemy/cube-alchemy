# Overview

Cube Alchemy turns pandas DataFrames into a unified analytic model and semantic layer—so you can explore data declaratively, with less joins and glue code.

## Capabilities

- Connects DataFrames automatically via shared column names

- Handles composite keys and complex relationships transparently

- Define reusable metrics and queries

- Maintain stateful context to compare scenarios

## Why It Matters

Ship insights faster and reduce maintenance.

- **Speed**: Relationships are discovered automatically

- **Simplicity**: Pure Python queries replace unnecessary ad‑hoc joins

- **Consistency**: Standardized metrics and filters yield reliable results

- **Maintainability**: Centralized business logic in reusable components

- **Integration**: Works great with Streamlit and other app frameworks

## Semantic Layer

Map raw tables to a consistent set of analysis concepts:

- **Dimensions**: Entities in your domain (e.g., Customer, Region, Product; Device, Study, Site)

- **Metrics**: Key measures (e.g., Revenue, Conversion Rate; Throughput, Accuracy)

- **Queries**: Analyses (e.g., Performance by Group; Trends over Time)
