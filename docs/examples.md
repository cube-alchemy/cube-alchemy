# Examples

## Cube Alchemy in Action

Welcome to our comprehensive collection of examples that demonstrate the power and flexibility of Cube Alchemy in real-world scenarios. Our [examples repository](https://github.com/cube-alchemy/cube-alchemy-examples) has been created to showcase the basic usage as well as some implementations across different domains and use cases.

### Adventure Works Sales Explorer

[View Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/cube-alchemy/cube-alchemy-examples/blob/main/kaggle/adventureworks/adventureworks%20-%20cube%20alchemy%20example.ipynb)

This notebook leverages a Kaggle version of the popular Adventure Works dataset to provide a step-by-step introduction to Cube Alchemy. It guides you through:

- Core functionality and fundamental concepts
- Essential workflow patterns
- Key methods and their practical applications
- Data exploration and visualization techniques

The idea of this example is to offer comprehensive introduction to the library's capabilities.

### Financial Analytics: Profit and Loss Hypercube

[View Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/cube-alchemy/cube-alchemy-examples/blob/main/synthetic/pnl/example%20pnl.ipynb)

This example demonstrates how to use Cube Alchemy to work with financial data, including modeling challenges:

- Constructs a Hypercube for Profit and Loss analysis using synthetic financial data
- Illustrates data transformation from raw inputs to dashboard-ready visualizations
- Demonstrates the conversion of the data into a connected undirected acyclic graph suitable for multidimensional analysis


## Streamlit Integration

### Interactive Data Applications

While Jupyter notebooks provide an excellent environment for analysis and exploration, Cube Alchemy truly shines when deployed in interactive data applications. Our seamless integration with Streamlit enables you to rapidly transform your analyses into powerful, user-friendly web applications.

Cube Alchemy provides an small plot rendering engine with a rich library of charts and visualizations designed specifically for multidimensional data exploration as well as a Filter component similar to the native multiselect.

### Live Demo Applications

These examples demonstrate how Cube Alchemy allows you to get from data to analysis seamlessly.

#### Interactive Development Environments
