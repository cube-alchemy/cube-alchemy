# Upcoming Features and Enhancements

This document serves as a backlog for tracking upcoming features, enhancements, and tasks planned for future development of the Cube Alchemy project. Contributions and suggestions from the community are welcome!

## Features

- [ ] **Cardinallity check and enforcement**: Could be useful to check at initialization whether the different connected tables are 'one-to-many;,'many-to-one' or 'many-to-many' and allow to notify the user.

- [ ] **Dimensions Hierarquies**: To be able to easily drill down and roll up easily, if we define hierarchies (eg.: Region -> Country -> State -> City) then we can define the queries with this hierarchies instead of simple dimensions. Then depending on the context state, the dimension which has one possible value can be automatically selected.

- [ ] **Query Visualization**: Same as metrics and queries definition, I imagine I also have the visualizations defined in a way that can be easily accessed. At least on it simply form (chart type, basic parameters) which can be used cross data visualization library.

## Enhancements

- [ ] **Error Handling**: Improve error messages and handling for better user experience.

- [ ] **Documentation Improvements**: Expand the documentation with more examples and use cases.
